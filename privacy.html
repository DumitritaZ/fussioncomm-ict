  <p class="muted" id="last-updated">Last updated: <!-- set by script --></p>

  <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
  <p>FussionComm ICT (“we”, “us”, “our”) is a startup ICT company based in Pretoria, South Africa. We provide web development and related services for startups and SMEs.</p>

  <h2>2) Scope</h2>
  <p>This policy explains what personal data we collect via this website, how we use it, and the choices you have. If you become a paying client, your project will also be governed by the terms in your service agreement.</p>

  <h2>3) Data we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contact form</strong>: name, email address, message content (and the time of submission and IP for anti-abuse).</li>
    <li><strong>Accounts (signup/login)</strong>: name, email, username, password (stored as a cryptographic hash), and basic activity such as last login.</li>
    <li><strong>Server logs</strong>: standard web logs (IP address, user-agent, pages viewed, timestamps) for security and troubleshooting.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: an authentication/session cookie (<code>fc_session</code>) if you sign in; basic preferences where applicable. We do not use advertising cookies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) How and why we use your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>To respond</strong> to inquiries you send via the contact form.</li>
    <li><strong>To provide access</strong> to the admin area for authorized users and maintain account security.</li>
    <li><strong>To protect the service</strong>, prevent abuse, and diagnose issues (security monitoring and logging).</li>
    <li><strong>To improve</strong> website usability and content (aggregate, non-identifying insights).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Legal bases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract</strong> — to provide requested services or respond to your request for a quote.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — security, fraud prevention, site performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> — where required (e.g., if we ever introduce optional analytics or marketing communications).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contact messages</strong>: typically up to 12 months unless a longer period is needed for a potential engagement or legal reasons.</li>
    <li><strong>Account data</strong>: for as long as the account is active; some records may remain in backups for a limited period.</li>
    <li><strong>Server logs</strong>: generally up to 30 days; security events may be kept longer.</li>
    <li><strong>Backups</strong>: encrypted backups may be retained up to 90 days.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Sharing & transfers</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your data. We may share limited data with trusted providers strictly to run this website (e.g., hosting, email/SMS). Those providers act under contracts and equivalent safeguards. Data may be processed in South Africa and, where relevant, other jurisdictions with appropriate protections.</p>

  <h2>8) Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard measures (encryption in transit, hashed passwords, access controls). No method is 100% secure, but we work to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or misuse.</p>

  <h2>9) Your rights</h2>
  <p>Subject to applicable law (including GDPR where relevant), you may request to:</p>
  <ul>

  </ul>
